        name: 'Umeko',
        role: 'Captain',
        description: 'Stubborn and reckless captain of the Clunkerfly, and (very bad) pilot, who insists on driving the ship herself. Her landings are less “touchdown” and more “controlled crash.” Almost always improvising, rarely planning (and often forgetting her plans halfway through), she\'s not exactly competent – yet her crew would—and has—followed her to the Hellish Corners of the Universe.',

    grease: {
        name: 'Grease',
        role: 'Mechanic',
        description: 'A mechanic who talks to the ship like it’s alive, sings lullabies to it, and occasionally threatens it with a wrench. She can fix anything, but she’s just as likely to dismantle something for fun and forget to put it back together. Rumor has it she once rebuilt the engine in her sleep.',
        catchphrase: 'She’s not broken, she’s just moody – right, Clunky? Let me talk to her.',
        drunken_message: '"Can you hear the left engine sing? That\'s beautiful, Clunky! ...Oh, actually, I think it\'s shutting down..."',

    doc: {
        name: 'Doc',
        role: 'Medic',
        description: 'A medic who doubles as a bartender—and occasionally as a philosopher, usually at the worst possible times. Nobody knows his real name or where he came from. He regularly gulps down suspicious "pills" which the crew can never see clearly, but which they suspect are just gummy bears. His quarters are the oldest and messiest on the Clunkerfly, home to a battered piano that he plays during high-speed chases and getaways from the Cosmic Police. Doc always has a story, a theory, or a tune—none of which ever seem to help with the situation.',
        catchphrase: 'You’re bleeding, the ship’s on fire, and I’m out of whiskey. Did I ever tell you about my time with space monks?',
        drunken_message: '"My boys! My beautiful rogues! Tomorrow\'s mission might be our last. Drink up, everybody!"'

    byte: {
        name: 'Byte',
        role: 'Hacker',
        description: 'A hacker who lives in the crawlspaces and never uses doors, instead creeping through maintenance shafts and popping out of vents. He "upgrades" the ship by frankensteining together salvaged tech, broken gadgets, and whatever random junk the crew hauls in.  He always carries a worn bunny keychain named “Patch,” and sometimes whispers to it when he thinks no one’s watching.',
        catchphrase: 'Yes, I know it sparks – that means it\'s working.',
        drunken_message: '"I just had a BRILLIANT idea: I\'m gonna re-route the quantum flux through the toaster!"'

    carrot: {
        name: 'Carrot',
        role: 'Cook',
        description: 'A cook who can whip up a meal from anything—edible or otherwise. A former convict turned space hustler, he’s filled with bizarre and extremely specific superstitions (never cooks while facing Jupiter, refuses to dice onions on Tuesdays). He reads the future using an ancient deck of poker cards, and while no one takes his predictions seriously, they still urge him "Ask your cards" when in doubt about something. He is unnervingly skilled with any blade, and keeps a stash of secret ingredients labeled "DO NOT ASK".',
        catchphrase: 'The stew bubbles clockwise... we’re in trouble.',
